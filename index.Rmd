## Bio

Hello, my name is Nicholas, and this is the Lost In A Tangent Book Club. The idea of connecting with people through the power of words has always been a passion project of mine on instagram. First, starting out as a hobby to keep myself accountable when trying to stay positive throughout the pandemic has turned out to be a collection of video journal entries. In these monthly entries, I pick a piece of literature (like a book or a poem) from my personal library of books that seems to never stop growing and draw out the themes that I get from the stories. I read hoping to spark conversation between the viewers who watch the videos. Looking ahead, these book talks I enjoy posting are preparing me for what the real world is like; by vicariously living through the words of the writers and their characters, I can begin to connect the dots between what others have said and what I experience. With this being said, it is pretty easy to get lost in a tangent, and sometimes it is not about the destination, finishing the books. The video entries about my journey through these books/words are the critical takeaway.
